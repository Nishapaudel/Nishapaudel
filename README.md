## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a bioinformatician with a strong commitment to continuous learning and adaptability in dynamic environments. Proficient in R, Python, and Bash scripting, I apply computational approaches to solve biological problems, particularly in genomic and transcriptomic data analysis. My expertise bridges biological laboratory techniques and computational skills, enabling me to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets.

Topic areas of interest:

* Population genetics study (evolution, spatial and temporal mapping, phylogenetic tree)
  
* RNA sequencing studies (Bulk and single cell RNA sequqning, enrichment and cell signelling pathway analysis)
  
* Precison medicine 
  
* Machine learning (Prediction and Clustering algorthms)
